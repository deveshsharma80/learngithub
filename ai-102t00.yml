  ### Module  1&#58; Create and Manage Azure Cognitive Services
  Prior to accessing any of the Cognitive Services functionality on Azure, you will need to create a Cognitive Services resource. Using the various services (Speech, Computer Vision etc.), requires, at a minimum, an access key and a service endpoint URL. The information is required for authorization of applications that will be accessing these services. You will create either a single-service resource or a multi-service resource, depending on the services you access.
